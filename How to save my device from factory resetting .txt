It was a very shocking day for me today! I was having a low battery in my Samsung Galaxy device and 
my apps Turned Off and icons removed after using Ultra Power Saving Mode! So weird! 
Then this trick saved my life! 

Go into Settings>Application Manager>Disabled Apps
Touch the "dot dot dot" at the top right and a drop down appears saying 
"Sort by size" and "Reset app preferences"
Touch "Reset app preferences" and it resets everything to default preferences.

Thanks google :P
